# m-apostrophe-bot

## Overview

This bot's sole purpose is to put apostrophes after words starting
with m for maximum euphoria.

A module for translating posts into Morse code is also being developed.

## To-do

Bot basis and functionality (e.g. putting apostrophes after words that start with m) would probably be seperated. Functionality would be its own module imported by the bot program.
